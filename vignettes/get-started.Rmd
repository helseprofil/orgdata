```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Presuming that `orgdata` package has been installed, this is how you can start
using the main function. Otherwise you can run the code below.
```r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes"))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("helseprofil/orgdata")
```

Alternatively is to clone user startup files ie. *seepafil.R* via terminal from
`user` branch.

```shell
git clone -b user https://github.com/helseprofil/orgdata
```


## Aggregate all files

To aggregate all files under a specific group such as *BEFOLKNING* group. 

```r
library(orgdata)
df <- read_org("BEFOLKNING")
df
```

If you are satisfy with the output and no error is shown during the process, you
could save the output as a `.csv` file with:

```r
save_file(df, "BEFOLKNING")
```

If you are certain that the process has been controlled before and everything
should be working correctly. You could save the output directly as a `.csv` file by:

```r
df <- read_org("BEFOLKNING", save = TRUE)
```

## Aggregate only selected files

Aggregating the whole files in a group could take a long time when there are
many files in the selected group. You could select only specific file or files
by selecting the `KOBLID` instead. The example below is for selecting one and
few files respectively.

```r
df <- read_org("BEFOLKNING", koblid = 4)
df <- read_org("BEFOLKNING", c(4,10,15))
```

## Process files without aggregating

When there is a need to look at the file prior to being aggregated. You could
specify argument `aggregate` as `TRUE`. You could also activate it globally via `options`.

```r
df <- read_org("BEFOLKNING", aggregate = FALSE)

# Global option
op <- options() 
options(orgdata.aggregate = FALSE)
df <- read_org("BEFOLKNING")
```

By activating it globally using `options`, all proceeding processes will not be
aggregated unless it's changed during function call or you reset the options if
you have saved the default with `op <- options()`.

```r
options(op)
```
